    Hey! Welcome to my little corner of the web! A dumping ground for all of my interests and such.
</p>

<p>
    I'm Travis, a CompSci student and proud owner of <a href="#nicknames">about 17.48 billion nicknames</a>.
    I hope you like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Comic+Neue">Comic Sans</a> (or rather Comic Neue) 
    because I use it everywhere!!
</p>

<p>
    At present, this site is awaiting the completion of <a href="https://github.com/jeff0282/webgoose">Webgoose</a>, 
    my little baby Static Site Generator Framework. I've created a <a href="https://webgoose.net">second site</a> to document
    its development.
</p>

<p>
    Until then, I'm just gonna dump everything on this homepage :3 !!

I'll answer this by answering some questions you didn't ask:

<h2>Interests</h2>
<p>
    This is by no means an exhaustative list - simply just the bigger hobbies of mine.
</p>


<h3>Programming</h3>
<p>
    I enjoy the process of designing and iterating on software solutions, though
    I do find I burn myself out quite often by spending far, far too much time on it.
</p>
<p>
    My current language best-friend is Python, though I yearn for strict typing... and 
    Typescript interfaces... 
</p>


<h3>Train/Bus-spotting et plus</h3>
<p>
    I've always loved buses and trains; the sounds especially.
</p>
<p>
    Below I've compiled a shortlist of my favourite types, rated best-at-the-top. 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Trains:</b>

                </ul>
            </li>

            <li>Volvo B9TL Wrightbus Eclipse Gemini 2</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Jeff-ing Around</h3>
<p>
    I describe "Jeff-ing Around" as just seeking out interesting things in everyday places.
</p>
<p>
    For me this tends to include Grafitti and Street Art, Public Installations and Architecture,
    Unusual Views, Abandoned/Poorly Maintained stuff and things like that.
</p>
<p>
    I'm not a backpacker or anything, but I like getting out and just exploring what's around.
</p>
    

<h3>Music & Audio Equipment</h3>
<p>
    I make passionate love to me Beyerdynamic DT1990 Pros everyday while blasting 'Deftones - This Place Is Death' like
    the goth girlie I am :3
</p>
<p>
    Music and sound are a huge part of my life. My music library may not be big, but that certainly doesn't hamper my
    enthusiasm. I'm a huge fan of interesting sound progressions and, with vocals, place more importance on vocalisation rather than the 
    vocals themselves.
</p>
<p>
    I've always quite enjoyed how different pieces of audio equipment colour the sound in their own way. Headphones are 
    very good for this. I tend to be a fan of a brighter sound signature, though I enjoy faithful representation of the full
    range of sound.
</p>


<h3>Bicycles and Bicycle Maintenance</h3>
<p>
    I love the feeling of building and maintaining something that you can actually use. For this, bicycles are perfect.
    With a couple of tools, some grit and patience, you can have a perfectly serviceable ride to work/wherever else.
</p>
<p>
    My current bike, the JeffBike 2, is a 3x9spd, fully rigid custom build based on a 2002 Specialised Rockhopper A1FS. It's predecessor, 
    a heavily modified 1998 Scott Rockwood (in bright, spanking yellow), was retired due to cracks forming in the siezed seatpost. RIP JeffBike 1, 1998-2023.
</p>
<p>
    I plan to try bikepacking later in the year, once it warms up, which I'll likely document on here.
</p>


<p>And some things I'm taking a foray into:</p>
<h3>Field Recording</h3>
<p>
    This is mostly an extension of train/bus-spotting and my love of everyday, underappreciated sounds.
    Unfortunately, my phone (Pixel 2) doesn't quite cut it, so I've had to purchase a "proper" solution
</p>
<p>
    With my recent aquisition of a Tascam DR-07MKII, I plan to record train traction motors, bus engines, and other 
    associated sounds like buzzers, bells, door chimes, ticket machines, etc.
