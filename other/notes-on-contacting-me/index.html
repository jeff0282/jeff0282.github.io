            <h1>Notes on contacting me</h1>
            <p>I view online messaging as an optional convenience, and not as a mandatory channel of communications. Consequently, I can be a little more difficult to get in-touch with than most! I've put together this page to hopefully offer some clarification on this.</p>
            <h2>TL;DR</h2>
            <p>Feel free to contact me, but I may be slower to respond than most.</p>
            <p>If I don't respond or stop responding, see below for a possible reason.</p>
            <h2>Why am I so wierd?</h2>
            <p>Modern messaging and its norms present a couple of problems for me:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Messaging platforms allow people to contact others at anytime, including at times when some may not want to talk.</li>
            <li>Read Receipts, common in most platforms, have fostered a culture of responding of soon as you've seen a message, even at inopportune times, for fear of being accused of ignoring others.</li>
            <li>The low barrier to entry means a lot of pointless messages and smalltalk get thrown about. This can be fun, though having to respond to even the smallest of messages can get tiring.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>As someone who is very introspective and requires a fair amount of time to myself, it can be more difficult to manage this. Consequently, I may at times limit what I respond to.</p>
            <h2>Ways of contacting me</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Phone</strong> <br> I reserve this for only those that need it. If you have these details, only call me if <strong>absolutely necessary</strong>, otherwise I may start ignoring you.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Email</strong> <br> I use my email as a general purpose means of communication, akin to a messaging platform.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Direct &amp; Group Messaging</strong> <br>
            Treated similarly to email, though details aren't given out as freely.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Servers</strong> <br>
            I tend to find servers or larger group-chats easier to talk in, as I'm more free to drop in-and-out when I please.</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>How to contact me</h2>
            <h3>If it's important</h3>
            <p>Email me.</p>
            <p>I respond to anything I deem important as soon as possible. This applies to most all formal, work, academic or otherwise urgent correspondence.</p>
            <p>I may provide synchronous contact methods to those who I deem require it, however this is rare.</p>
            <h3>If it's not important</h3>
            <p>Feel free to get in-touch, though bare in mind that I can't offer any guarantee of a response time or whether I'll respond at all. Chances are I will respond, if a little more slowly than most</p>
            <p>If you may have multiple ways of contacting me, feel free to use what you feel would be most appropriate.</p>
            <p>Below are things that I likely won't respond to.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Smalltalk</strong> <br>
            I likely won't respond.</p>
            <p>There are very few exceptions to this rule, such as if I don't see you very often. If frequent, I may stop responding entirely.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Unnecessary Phone Calls</strong> <br>
            If you have my number and try to call me for things that aren't important, I may stop responding alltogether.</p>
            <p>I see phone calls as a demand for my attention, and get quite annoyed if that's abused.</p>
            <p>Message me instead.</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
            <h2>You haven't responded and I don't understand why?</h2>
            <p>If I'm not getting back to you, and you're sure it's not due to anything above, here are some possible reasons</p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            <p><strong>I have died</strong> <br>
            Very sorry for any inconvenience caused.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>I might be restricting my usage of devices/services</strong> <br>
            If you contact me whilst I'm doing this, I likely won't see it for some time.</p>
            <p>Try emailing me if you haven't already, I tend to always keep an eye on that.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>I might be away</strong> <br>
            I may be on holiday or otherwise away.</p>
            <p>Sometimes I go camping, bikepacking, etc. During such a time I may not be in range of a network.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>Network/Technical Issues</strong> <br>
            My home network is notoriously unreliable. However, I will likely check for any correspondence elsewhere if possible.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>I just don't want to talk</strong> <br>
            At times, I might just not want to talk to many people. This isn't very common, and I'll still be responding to important correspondence.</p>
            <p>I have been known to do this for months.. However this is thankfully very, very rare.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
            <p><strong>I just don't want to talk to you</strong> <br>
            As with anyone, this is always a possibilty. It may be temporary, permanent, or semi-permanent depending on circumstances.</p>
            <p>It isn't necessarily black-and-white, I may limit how much I'm willing to talk.</p>
            </li>
            </ul>
